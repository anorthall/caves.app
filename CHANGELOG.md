# Changes to caves.app
A summary of changes made to caves.app, organised by version, can be found below.

## Version 2.0
Version 2.0 of caves.app is the result of around a month of my free time and
consists of a complete stylistic and functional redesign of the application as
well as many new features and improvements to the user experience.

### User profiles
- A new header section shows the user and their avatar more prominently.
- All user information is now contained within tabs under the user biography.
- The trip list has been redesigned and made easier to use and read.
- A photo gallery, consisting of all the photos a user has added, is now available.
  - The photo gallery adapts to who is viewing it - only photos they would have
permission to view on the relevant trip page are displayed.
- The statistics table has been redesigned and a legend modal has been added.
- An 'info' section has been added, with account statistics.
- Friends and mutual friends are now shown in the right sidebar, or in a tab.
