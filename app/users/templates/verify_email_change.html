      You're almost there! Just one more thing - you need to verify your
      new email address before it is updated on your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please check your
      email for a unique code which has been sent to you. You can then click
      the link in the email, or enter the code into the box below. If you
      did not receive the code, and it isn't in your email spam folder, please
      submit the <a class="link-secondary" href="{% url 'users:email' %}">email
      change</a> form again to resend it. Alternatively, send me an
      <a class="link-secondary" href="mailto:andrew@northall.me.uk">email</a>
      and I will be able to help.
