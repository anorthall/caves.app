Hi {{ name }},


Just a quick email to let you know that {{ commenter_name }} has left
a new comment on your trip to {{ trip.cave_name }} on {{ trip.start|date }}.

They said:

{{ comment_content }}

You can view the comment here:

{{ SITE_ROOT }}{{ trip.get_absolute_url }}

If you'd like to disable these emails you can do so in your user settings page.

Thanks for using caves.app!


Cheers,
