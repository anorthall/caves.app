Hi {{ name }},


Just a quick email to let you know that {{ commenter_name }} has left
a new comment on a trip to {{ trip.cave_name }} on {{ trip.start|date }}.

They said:

{{ comment_content }}

You can view the trip here:

{{ SITE_ROOT }}{{ trip.get_absolute_url }}

If you'd like to disable email notifications for this trip you can do so
by clicking 'Unfollow' on the trip page. Alternatively, you can disable all
email notifications of new comments by visiting the account settings page.

Thanks for using caves.app!


Cheers,
