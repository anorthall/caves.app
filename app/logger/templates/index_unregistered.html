      caves.app is the modern way to log your underground activity
    </p>

    <p>
      A streamlined, mobile-friendly interface allows you to record and view your caving trips
      from anywhere. Keep detailed records of everything you've done &mdash; who was there, the
      distance you surveyed, how long you spent underground, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can easily share your activities with friends via your public profile, with the option
      to keep your trips private if you prefer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The service is free to use and you have complete control over your data. There is no reason not
      to give it a go! Want more information? Have a look at the <a href="{% url 'core:about' %}">about page</a>.
