      I thought I'd give you a few hints on how to best use the site. This page will disappear once you've added three
      trips. Follow the steps below to get started:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li class="mb-2">
        Head across to your <a href="{% url 'users:update' %}">user profile</a> and add some details about your
        location, and what caving clubs you are a member of. Please note that timezone handling and distance
        unit conversion is not yet implemented. All timezones are in UTC (GMT+0000) and all distances are
        in metres.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-2">
        <a href="{% url 'log:trip_create' %}">Add your first trips!</a> The form should be straightforward enough
        and the only required data to create a trip is the cave name and trip start time.
      </li>

      <li>
        Enjoy the website! It is being actively developed and you may come across features that do not work properly.
        If you do, please <a href="mailto:admin@caves.app">let me know</a> immediately by sending an email to
        <code>admin@caves.app</code> and I will do my best to fix them.
      </li>
    </ol>
