    About caves.app

    <p class="lead">
      I created caves.app after finding that using spreadsheets to maintain a record of my caving activity was
      cumbersome and inconvenient. It has been initially developed for my own use, but I have made the service available
      freely online in the hope that other cavers may find it useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hopefully, the use of a mobile accessible website with a streamlined interface will enable others to more easily keep
      track of their caving activity and allow better sharing of activities. This website <strong>is not</strong> supposed to
      be a database of caves - all of your added data is completely private (unless you opt to make it public), and other users
      cannot (by default) see what caves you have added.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am also not intending to 'lock in' anyone to this platform. If you find it useful - great - if not, it is my intention
      that all data will be easily exported via means of an comma separated text file, so that anyone can back up their own data
      at any time, or leave the platform if they so wish. I take being entrusted with your (potentially irreplaceable) data very
      seriously, and regular backups are performed.

    <h5>Current and planned features</h5>
    <p>
      This website is in active development and not all features are currently implemented. Notably, <strong>timezone and distance
      unit handling</strong> is not implemented. All units of distance are measured in metres and all times are entered/displayed in
      UTC (GMT+0000). <strong>Public profiles are also currently not implemented.</strong> Even though you may select a privacy setting
      for your trips and profile, it has no affect, as there is no public view for trips or profiles implemented yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other features which will be implemented but are not yet include: the adding of photos to trips, import and export of data
      via CSV file, a trash bin for deleted trips (all deletions are permanent!), a friends/social 'timeline' functionality, and a
      'trip report' functionality which would show rich text trip reports in the style of a blog post.
    </p>


    <h5 class="mt-4">Contact and support</h5>
    <p>
      If you encounter any issues, however minor, with the website then please do send me an email and let me know. I am keen to get things
      fixed promptly and would really appreciate your feedback, even if it is negative. The same goes if you believe a particular user flow
