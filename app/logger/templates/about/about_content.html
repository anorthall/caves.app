      Using spreadsheets to maintain a record of caving activity is cumbersome and inconvenient. caves.app solves this problem.
      Although originally developed for my own personal use, I have made the service freely available to all in the hope other cavers will find it useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      caves.app is easily used on any device with an internet connection, and has a minimalist interface that is designed to make
      recording data quick and easy. <strong>Your privacy and the protection of your data is my priority</strong> &mdash; all of your
      information is visible only to you (unless you opt to make it public), and other users cannot (by default) see what caves
      you have added.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Your data is your property.</strong> If you do not find the website useful then you can <a href="{% url 'log:export'%}">
      export your data to a CSV file at any time</a>. I take being entrusted with your (potentially irreplaceable) data very seriously
      and best efforts are made, including regular off-site backups, to protect against any loss of recorded data.

    <h5>Current and planned features</h5>
    <p>
      This website is in active development and not all features are currently implemented. Notably, <strong>public profiles
      are not yet available.</strong> Privacy settings exist in your user profile and for individual trips, but there is no way
      for anyone but you to view your data yet. It is good practice to select the privacy mode regardless, for
      when such a feature is implemented.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other features which will be implemented but are not yet include: the adding of photos to trips, a trash bin for deleted trips
      (all deletions are permanent!), a friends/social 'timeline' functionality, and a 'trip report' functionality which would show
      rich text trip reports in the style of a blog post.
    </p>
