    <p class="lead">This website is in active development and sometimes things may not go as smoothly as we'd like.</p>

    <p>
      If you need any help with anything, or if you've encountered a problem with the site, then please do not hesitate to
      <a href="mailto:admin@caves.app">send me an email</a> and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Equally, any
      feedback &mdash; positive or negative &mdash; is very welcome.
    </p>

    <p>There are also certain tasks I can help with, on request:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Import of a large amount of trips</strong> &mdash; if you have a large amount of trip data, perhaps
        stored in a spreadsheet, I'd be happy to help add it to the site.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Bulk editing</strong> &mdash; for example bulk deletions, or changing the formatting of many fields.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Account deletion</strong> &mdash; if you no longer wish to use the site.
      </li>
    </ul>
